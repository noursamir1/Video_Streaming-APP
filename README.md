# Video_Streaming-APP
In this work, the concept of multi-media streaming is applied by implementing an android application using Android Studio as the development tool and Firebase as the real-time database and storage provider. 
The application uses authentication techniques as it is divided into a Sign in Activity for users to enter their credentials, a Register activity, provided video names List Activity and finally a Video activity that streams the chosen video by the user in a real-time manner.
# Hint
You are going to find the application Android Studio Java code in the folder named "VideoStreaming_Code" and the application layout design code in the folder named "Layout_Code".
Moreover, you are going to find the explanation of how the code was implemented and connected to Firebase in our report file that is named "VideoStreamin_App_Report.docx"
